# Week 14
## Exercise 1
Given two `String`s *s1* and *s2*, print each character from *s2* that appears in *s1* (hint: for best performance, use a HashMap to store the characters of the first `String` and then look up each character from the second `String`).

## Exercise 2
Given a `String` of characters, print the character that occurs *k* times (*k* is the first command line argument, the `String` is the second command line argument).

## Exercise 3
Given a `String` *s*, find the first non-repeating character in it and print its index. If no such character exists, print -1

#Exercise 4
- Using the `upperBounding` example code, try passing a non-`Shape` to the generic method and see what happens.
- Now define a marker interface called `TwoDimensional` and make it an additional bounding criteria for computing the total area
